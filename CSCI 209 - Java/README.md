# Homework 08: Heat Simulation using 2D Arrays

## Overview
In this assignment, I developed multiple Java programs to simulate the heating of a metal plate using a 2D array to represent a 100 x 100 cm piece of metal. The programs allow for dynamic input, simulating heat changes over a specified number of iterations.

## Programs
- **make2d.java**: Creates the initial 2D array representing the metal plate.
- **print_2d.java**: Outputs the 2D array values.
- **stencil_2d.java**: Simulates heat changes across the metal plate based on surrounding values.
- **plot_data.py**: Python script to plot the data from the 2D array.
- **generate_movie.py**: Python script to generate a GIF representing the metal heating process over multiple iterations.
- **gather_data.py**: Collects and organizes the data for processing.
- **display_image.py**: Displays the final frames of the metal heating process.

## Key Features
- The program allows users to input the number of iterations for the heat simulation.
- Heat distribution is calculated and applied across the 2D array for each iteration.
- The final output is a GIF that visually demonstrates the heating process over time, where each iteration corresponds to one frame of the GIF.

## Learning Outcomes
This project reinforced my knowledge of:
- 2D array manipulation in Java
- Basic numerical simulation concepts
- Integration of Python for visualization and data analysis
